This project represents my first contribution to GitHub. The goal of the project is to create a Minecraft plugin that provides a convenient API for managing custom items. The API includes events related to items such as throwing, picking up, burning, interacting with, and more. In addition, it provides methods for creating custom items with specific types, display names, descriptions, enchantments, flags, and so on. The logic behind the project involves implementing the following: Creating a convenient API to work with custom items; developing three examples of custom items to demonstrate API functionality; and providing examples of items like Ifrit Rod and Grimoire of Fire.Action: When you take this book in your hand (by scrolling the mouse wheel on the hotbar or by moving it from inventory to your hand), particles of fire will appear around you, setting fire to any creatures (LivingEntities) within a 1.5 - 2.0 block radius of you. When you remove the book from your hand, the igniting effect will stop. Grenade Type: Dynamite Name: Grenade Action: When you throw this grenade and it hits the ground, it will disappear and an explosion will occur where it landed. Instructions for Use: Clone the repository to your local machine. Install the plugin onto your Minecraft server. Use the provided API to create and manage custom items on your server application.
